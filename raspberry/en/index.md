I've been using Raspberry-Pi cards since version 1.A+. I find it a very nice and easy boart to play with embedded or distributed systems. It's limitations, specially is processing power, are great to remember us about optimization and that over-engineering not always work.

My goal here is to report some experiences and solutions to issues I had, through the years, using this little board for things like embedded and distributed systems, network services and even art (as the project [Língua Mãe](https://www.camilaproto.com/cubic), that you can access the [repository](https://github.com/rafasgj/linguamae)).

If you can read portuguese, there are [some other posts](/raspberry) you can read.
